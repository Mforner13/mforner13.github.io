                The town and most of its attractions tend to get very crowded with visitors as well as locals, especially in the peak tourist seasons so visiting the city in off seasons is the best thing to do<center><br><br></p>

    			<p class="first"><center>Of Brescia’s numerous churches, the Duomo Vecchio (Old Cathedral), on the Piazza Paolo VI stands out. Built in the 11th century, it is remarkable for its circular shape that was unusual in medieval times. The nearby Piazza della Loggia was constructed by the Venetians in the 15th century. It houses the Torre dell’Orologio (clock tower) with a gleaming astronomical clock flanked by moving statues that ring the hours. The Renaissance square is the site of the 13th-century Broletto civic offices, capped by the Torre del Pegol (Tower of Pegol), which was once a focal meeting point and the sound of its bells used to summon citizens.<center> <br><br></p>
